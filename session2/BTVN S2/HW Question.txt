Write a program that asks user their height (cm) and weight (kg), and then calculate their BMI (Body Mass Index):
BMI = mass (kg) / (height(m) x height(m) )
Note: you must do the conversion from cm to m before calculation

Then based on the BMI, tell them that they are:
Severely underweight if BMI < 16
Underweight if BMI is between 16 and 18.5
Normal if BMI is between 18.5 and 25 
Overweight if BMI is between 25 and 30
Obese if BMI is more than 30

Write a program that
Asks users enter a number and then calculates factorial of n: (1 * 2 * 3 *... *n)
Study how to print without moving to a new line
Each time we call print(...) to print out something, python will automatically move to a new line, for example, the following snippet:

print("Hello")
print(",my name")
print("is B-max")

will result:

Hello
,my name
is B-max

Your task: Try to search and learn how to print without moving to new line,:

print("Hello", ...) 
print(",my name", ...)
print("is B-max", ...)

# "..." is the piece of code you would add

so that the result would be

Hello,my name is B-max

Print out the following patterns, remember that the number of columns and rows can be changed later, so try to write programs that can scale

20 x 1 stars:

            * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

n stars (n is entered by users)

Enter a number: 17
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

9 stars and xs in total

      x * x * x * x * x

n stars and xs in total (n is entered by users)

Enter a number: 13
x * x * x * x * x * x * x

You can use print(), (yes, print with nothing inside the parentheses ()) to move to a new line, try it

7 x 3 stars
    
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
        
n x m stars (n, m are entered by users)

Enter n: 5
Enter m: 3
